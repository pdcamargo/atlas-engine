/**
 * One-Shot Compute Example
 *
 * This example demonstrates on-demand execution of compute shaders:
 * - Workers configured with .oneShot() only execute when explicitly triggered
 * - Useful for operations that don't need to run every frame
 * - Examples: batch processing, user-triggered effects, one-time calculations
