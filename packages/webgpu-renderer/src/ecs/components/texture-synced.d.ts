 * TextureSynced marker component
 *
 * Flags Sprite entities that have had their texture handles resolved to actual Textures.
 * Used to optimize queries - prevents re-checking already-loaded sprites every frame.
 *
 * This is automatically added by the textureLoadingSystem when a handle is loaded.
